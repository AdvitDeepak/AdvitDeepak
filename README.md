## About Me 😄

Hi, I'm Advit! I'm a Computer Science and Engineering student at UCLA 🐻 (class of 2025). 

Be it using Computer Vision to create touchless human interface devices (HIDs) or creating a Reinforcement-Learning traffic controller 
with the Simulation for Urban Mobility (SUMO), I'm interested in all sorts of new technologies and their applications 😊. 

From flying suits to interactable holograms — we have so many applications requiring computational innovations yet to be engineered. 
Making these kinds of technological leaps and working towards this Sci-Fi future are the reasons why I pursue CS. 

*It’s the most realistic form of magic I know.*
